# résumé-template

This is the template for my own personal résumé, made using [Typst](https://typst.app). It's inspired by my previous résumé, which was typeset in LaTeX. The formatting is deliberately very minimal.

Feel free to use it for your own résumé.

## Usage

Put the [template file](./template.typ) in your project and include it in your main document. See the [example document](./example.typ) for an example of how to do this, and the [example pdf](./example.pdf) to see what the output looks like.

## Contributions

I'm putting this up because I think it might be useful. Open an issue or a PR if you want and I'll look at it, but it isn't really a priority for me.
